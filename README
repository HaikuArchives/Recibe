Recibe
A Recipe Manager for BeOS
1.0 Beta 1

About This Version

This would be the first release and it is what beta software really should be: stable as far as I can tell in regular use, but it is still possible that there are bugs in there somewhere. 

This project wasn't even supposed to exist. Like Mr. Peeps! I just sort of fell into it, and, once again, I'm glad I did. Recibe started out as a way for me to use recipes I already have a license to under Windows with software that has more recipes than I could make in a lifetime, even if I made a new one literally each meal. The software's recipes were stored in some sort of proprietary database, but I wrote a program to automatically save each recipe to a text file. After getting tired of beating my CD-ROM drive to death by ripping a couple of hundred thousand recipes to disk, I went searching on the Internet and discovered more than a couple of recipes which are now distributed with Recibe.

The Recipes

The database as of this writing contains some 52,000 or so recipes. I do not claim authorship or ownership of any of them. Many are attributed to someone or another, but many more are not. If you are the author of one or more recipes and would like them to  be removed, please contact me and I will do so.

I hope you enjoy Recibe and happy cooking!
